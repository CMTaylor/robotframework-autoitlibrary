AutoItLibrary
=============

Introduction
------------

AutoItLibrary is a Python keyword library that extends Robot Framework
(http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/) by providing keywords based on the
COM interface to AutoIt (http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/index.shtml).
AutoIt is a freeware tool for automating the Windows GUI.

In order to do screenshots, the AutoItLibrary uses the Open Source Python
Image Library tool PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/).


Installation
------------

AutoItLibrary installs its own file and, if not already present, the 3rd party
AutoIt and PIL tools.  To install, unzip the release file into a temporary
directory on your PC, open a command window in that directory and type:

    python setup.py install

This installation creates the folder:

   C:\RobotFramework\Extensions\AutoItLibrary

on your PC and puts various files into this directory folder.


Documentation
-------------

AutoItLibrary documentation is installed by the installation process into

    C:\RobotFramework\Extensions\AutoItLibrary\AutoItLibrary.html

The AutoItX documentation is also installed into this folder as AutoItX.chm.


Tests
-----

The AutoItLibrary installer puts a suite of self-tests here:

    C:\RobotFramework\Extensions\AutoItLibrary\tests

To run these tests, which exercise the Windows Calculator GUI, run the
RunTests.bat file in the above folder.
